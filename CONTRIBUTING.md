We welcome all kinds of contributions including bug reports, feature requests, documentation updates, and code improvements.

This guide explains how to contribute, how issues are handled, and what is expected from contributors.

## 📌 Reporting Bugs 🐛

If you find a bug, please open an issue on GitHub. **You must use the provided "Bug Report" template** when creating the issue. This ensures we have all the technical details needed to fix the problem.

A valid bug report must include:
- A clear and concise description of the issue.
- Precise steps to reproduce the behavior.
- Expected vs actual behavior.
- **Environment Details:** Browser, OS, and Node.js version.
- Screenshots or console error logs.

Feature ideas and enhancements are welcome. **Please use the "Feature Request" template** to propose new modules or UI improvements.

When suggesting a feature:
- Clearly explain the problem it solves.

- Mention possible alternatives or mockups if available.

Please ensure the issue is labeled correctly as `feature` or `enhancement`.

## 🚀 Pull Request Guidelines

Before opening a Pull Request, ensure you follow these standards:

1. **Use the PR Template:** Every PR must fill out the `.github/pull_request_template.md`. PRs without a completed checklist will not be reviewed.
2. **Sync your branch:** Make sure your branch is up to date with `main`.
3. **Reference Issues:** Use keywords to link your PR to an issue (e.g., `Fixes #75`).
4. **Validation:** - For **Frontend**: Verify changes in both Light and Dark modes.
   - For **Backend**: Ensure API proxy logic is tested and `.env.example` is updated.
5. **Visuals:** Attach screenshots or GIFs for any UI/UX modifications.

## 💻 Code Contributions

### Issue Assignment

- Comment on the issue you want to work on
- Wait for a maintainer to assign the issue before starting
- Avoid working on unassigned issues to prevent duplicate efforts

## 🔁 Contribution Workflow

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Create a new branch
4. Make changes
5. Commit and push
6. Open a Pull Request


### 🌱 Branch Rules

- Do **not** commit directly to the `main` branch
- Always create a separate branch for your work

#### Branch naming format:

Example branch name:  
`feature/add-dark-mode`

While working on your contribution:
- Keep changes limited to **one issue per PR**
- Follow existing code patterns and formatting
- Avoid unrelated refactoring
